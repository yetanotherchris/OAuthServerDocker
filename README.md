# OAuthServer Docker

This repository contains two implementations of a .NET OAuth/Open ID Connect server using IdentityServer4 and OpenIdDict as the libraries to provide the implementations.

Both have pre-canned users you can login as, and test OIDC (Open ID Connect) flows with. They are also coupled with dockerfiles to run inside Docker.
